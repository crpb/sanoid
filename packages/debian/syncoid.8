.TP
SOURCE
Source ZFS dataset. Can be either local or remote
.TP
TARGET
Target ZFS dataset. Can be either local or remote
.IP
Options:
.TP
\fB\-\-compress\fR=\fI\,FORMAT\/\fR
Compresses data during transfer. Currently accepted options are gzip, pigz\-fast, pigz\-slow, zstd\-fast, zstd\-slow, lz4, xz, lzo (default) & none
.TP
\fB\-\-identifier\fR=\fI\,EXTRA\/\fR
Extra identifier which is included in the snapshot name. Can be used for replicating to multiple targets.
.TP
\fB\-\-recursive\fR|r
Also transfers child datasets
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-parent\fR
Skips syncing of the parent dataset. Does nothing without '\-\-recursive' option.
.TP
\fB\-\-source\-bwlimit=\fR<limit k|m|g|t>
Bandwidth limit in bytes/kbytes/etc per second on the source transfer
.TP
\fB\-\-target\-bwlimit=\fR<limit k|m|g|t>
Bandwidth limit in bytes/kbytes/etc per second on the target transfer
.TP
\fB\-\-mbuffer\-size\fR=\fI\,VALUE\/\fR
Specify the mbuffer size (default: 16M), please refer to mbuffer(1) manual page.
.TP
\fB\-\-pv\-options\fR=\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR
Configure how pv displays the progress bar, default '\-p \fB\-t\fR \fB\-e\fR \fB\-r\fR \fB\-b\fR'
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-stream\fR
Replicates using newest snapshot instead of intermediates
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-sync\-snap\fR
Does not create new snapshot, only transfers existing
.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-sync\-snap\fR
Don't destroy created sync snapshots
.TP
\fB\-\-create\-bookmark\fR
Creates a zfs bookmark for the newest snapshot on the source after replication succeeds (only works with \fB\-\-no\-sync\-snap\fR)
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-hold\fR
Adds a hold to the newest snapshot on the source and target after replication succeeds and removes the hold after the next successful replication. The hold name includes the identifier if set. This allows for separate holds in case of multiple targets
.HP
\fB\-\-preserve\-recordsize\fR Preserves the recordsize on initial sends to the target
.HP
\fB\-\-preserve\-properties\fR Preserves locally set dataset properties similar to the zfs send \fB\-p\fR flag but this one will also work for encrypted datasets in non raw sends
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-rollback\fR
Does not rollback snapshots on target (it probably requires a readonly target)
.HP
\fB\-\-delete\-target\-snapshots\fR With this argument snapshots which are missing on the source will be destroyed on the target. Use this if you only want to handle snapshots on the source.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fI\,REGEX\/\fR
DEPRECATED. Equivalent to \fB\-\-exclude\-datasets\fR, but will be removed in a future release. Ignored if \fB\-\-exclude\-datasets\fR is also provided.
.HP
\fB\-\-exclude\-datasets\fR=\fI\,REGEX\/\fR Exclude specific datasets which match the given regular expression. Can be specified multiple times
.HP
\fB\-\-exclude\-snaps\fR=\fI\,REGEX\/\fR Exclude specific snapshots that match the given regular expression. Can be specified multiple times. If a snapshot matches both the exclude\-snaps and include\-snaps patterns, then it will be excluded.
.HP
\fB\-\-include\-snaps\fR=\fI\,REGEX\/\fR Only include snapshots that match the given regular expression. Can be specified multiple times. If a snapshot matches both the exclude\-snaps and include\-snaps patterns, then it will be excluded.
.HP
\fB\-\-sendoptions\fR=\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR Use advanced options for zfs send (the arguments are filtered as needed), e.g. syncoid \fB\-\-sendoptions=\fR"Lc e" sets zfs send \fB\-L\fR \fB\-c\fR \fB\-e\fR ...
.HP
\fB\-\-recvoptions\fR=\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR Use advanced options for zfs receive (the arguments are filtered as needed), e.g. syncoid \fB\-\-recvoptions=\fR"ux recordsize o compression=lz4" sets zfs receive \fB\-u\fR \fB\-x\fR recordsize \fB\-o\fR compression=lz4 ...
.TP
\fB\-\-sshconfig\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR
Specifies an ssh_config(5) file to be used
.TP
\fB\-\-sshkey\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR
Specifies a ssh key to use to connect
.TP
\fB\-\-sshport\fR=\fI\,PORT\/\fR
Connects to remote on a particular port
.TP
\fB\-\-sshcipher\fR|c=CIPHER
Passes CIPHER to ssh to use a particular cipher set
.TP
\fB\-\-sshoption\fR|o=OPTION
Passes OPTION to ssh for remote usage. Can be specified multiple times
.TP
\fB\-\-insecure\-direct\-connection\fR=\fI\,IP\/\fR:PORT[,IP:PORT]
WARNING: DATA IS NOT ENCRYPTED. First address pair is for connecting to the target and the second for listening at the target
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this helptext
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Prints the version number
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Prints out a lot of additional information during a syncoid run
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\-version\fR
Currently does nothing
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppresses non\-error output
.TP
\fB\-\-dumpsnaps\fR
Dumps a list of snapshots during the run
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-command\-checks\fR
Do not check command existence before attempting transfer. Not recommended
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-resume\fR
Don't use the ZFS resume feature if available
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-clone\-handling\fR
Don't try to recreate clones on target
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-privilege\-elevation\fR
Bypass the root check, for use with ZFS permission delegation
