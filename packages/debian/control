Description: Policy-driven ZFS snapshot management and replication tool
 Sanoid is a policy-driven snapshot management and replication tool for ZFS
 filesystems.
 .
 More prosaically, you can use Sanoid to create, automatically thin, and
 monitor snapshots and pool health from a single eminently human-readable
 TOML config file. Sanoid also includes a replication tool, syncoid, which
 facilitates the asynchronous incremental replication of ZFS filesystems.
